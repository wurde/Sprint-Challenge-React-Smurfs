1.  Explain the differences between `client-side routing` and `server-side routing`.

Client-side routing is where an application needs to navigate a user around without sending requests to the server. A popular method for doing this is via the [React Router](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-router-dom) dependency. It adds 3 objects to state `location`, `history`, and `match`.

Server-side routing is the traditional way websites navigate a user around through multiple request to the server. A user can click an anchor tag, a request is sent to the server, and the response is then loaded on the client.

3.  What does HTTP stand for?

It stands for Hypertext Transfer Protocol. It is an important layer of infrastructure for the Internet. It provides a standardized way for machines to talk to each other.

4.  What does CRUD stand for?

It stands for Create, Read, Update, and Delete functions in computer programming. These are the primary operations to enable when building RESTful routes.

5.  Which HTTP methods can be mapped to the CRUD acronym that we use when interfacing with APIs/Servers.

- (HTTP) POST for CREATE (CRUD).
- (HTTP) GET for READ (CRUD).
- (HTTP) PUT for UPDATE (CRUD).
- (HTTP) DELETE for DELETE (CRUD).

6.  Mention three tools we can use to make AJAX requests

- [Axios](https://npmjs.com/package/axios)
- [jQuery](https://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/)
- [Fetch API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API)
